**Drum Kit — Interactive Music Experience**

- **Project:**: A lightweight, browser-based Drum Kit that maps click and keyboard events to drum sounds. It provides a playful, responsive UI for interacting with drum pads.

**Quick Start**
- **Prerequisites:**: A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and VS Code with the Live Server extension (optional)
- **Serve locally (recommended — Live Server):**

1. Open the project folder in VS Code:

2. In VS Code, install the **Live Server** extension (if not already installed), then right-click `index.html` and choose **Open with Live Server**. The page will open in your browser (usually at a localhost URL such as `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`).


- **Open:** `http://localhost:8000/index.html` (or the Live Server URL shown by the extension)

**How to Use**
- **Click:**: Click any drum pad to play the corresponding sound.
- **Keyboard:**: Press `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l` to trigger the drum pads via keyboard.
- **Visual feedback:**: Pads have hover and pressed states for clear interaction feedback.
